# WareSoft / ManaVitae Manifesto (EN)

Software is a tool — and also a language.
At WareSoft, we treat systems as craftsmanship: every decision must earn its place.

## What we pursue
Build products with **clarity, performance, and integrity**.
Less excess. More meaning. Less noise. More real value.

## Our principles
- **The domain leads:** the real problem shapes the system.
- **Scalable simplicity:** the smallest thing that works well, ready to grow.
- **Clean architecture:** intentional dependencies, low coupling, testable by design.
- **Performance with responsibility:** fast, stable, predictable — from database to UI.
- **Security and privacy by default:** not a feature, the foundation.
- **Living documentation:** decisions recorded (README, ADRs, CHANGELOG) to avoid amnesia.
- **Accessibility and dark mode from day one:** respect is a requirement.
- **Continuous delivery:** iterate small, measure, improve — always.

## Commitments
- Ship with **measurable quality** (tests, observability, review).
- Reduce complexity before adding new layers.
- Prefer **proven robustness** over trends — adopt trends only when they pay off.
- Build software that **works, communicates, and lasts**.

> We don’t build to fill screens.
> We build systems that matter.
